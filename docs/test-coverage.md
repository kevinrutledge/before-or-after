# Test Coverage

Review test coverage metrics across frontend and backend systems. Examine
testing methodology and coverage percentages to assess code quality.

Last updated: June 2025

## Overview

Analyze test coverage data across the Before or After project. The system
includes 657 total tests that cover both React frontend components and Node.js
backend services. Tests run automatically through continuous integration
workflows.

## Frontend Coverage

Examine frontend test coverage metrics.

**Coverage Summary: 85.32%**

| Metric     | Percentage | Status |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Statements | 85.32%     | Pass   |
| Branches   | 80.18%     | Pass   |
| Functions  | 85.50%     | Pass   |
| Lines      | 85.65%     | Pass   |

**Test Statistics:**

- 451 passing tests
- 35 test suites
- 17.2 second execution time

### Component Coverage Details

Review components that achieve complete test coverage.

**Components with 100% Coverage:**

- Background.jsx
- Card.jsx
- Layout.jsx
- LossGifCard.jsx
- PageContainer.jsx
- ProtectedRoute.jsx
- ResultOverlay.jsx
- HomePage.jsx
- LeaderboardPage.jsx

**Components with High Coverage:**

- AuthContext.jsx (96% statements)
- AdminDashboard.jsx (93.84% statements)
- LoginPage.jsx (92.85% statements)
- SignupPage.jsx (90.24% statements)

### Testing Methodology

Examine frontend testing approach. Tests use React Testing Library to validate
component rendering and user interactions. Mock implementations replace external
API calls during test execution. Test utilities provide consistent
authentication state and cleanup patterns.

Frontend tests cover React Context state management, form validation, navigation
flows, and error handling scenarios.

## Backend Coverage

Review backend test coverage metrics.

**Coverage Summary: 82.55%**

| Metric     | Percentage | Status |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Statements | 82.55%     | Pass   |
| Branches   | 80.00%     | Pass   |
| Functions  | 96.66%     | Pass   |
| Lines      | 82.78%     | Pass   |

**Test Statistics:**

- 206 passing tests
- 19 test suites
- 5.8 second execution time

### API Coverage Details

Review backend testing coverage across modules.

**Tested Modules:**

- Authentication routes with JWT token validation
- Password reset flows with email verification codes
- Admin routes with role-based access controls
- Database models with MongoDB operations
- Card management with image processing workflows

### Testing Infrastructure

Examine backend testing architecture. Tests use MongoDB Memory Server that
creates isolated database instances for each test suite. Test utilities generate
valid JWT tokens and provide database cleanup functions.

Backend tests cover API endpoint functionality, database model operations,
middleware authentication, and error response handling.

## Testing Standards

### Coverage Requirements

Maintain 80% minimum coverage threshold across all metrics. Both frontend and
backend systems meet this requirement. Coverage thresholds prevent deployment of
untested code changes.

### Test Organization

Follow consistent patterns across test suites:

- Unit tests validate individual functions and components
- Integration tests verify API endpoints and user workflows
- Mock implementations isolate external dependencies
- Cleanup utilities reset database state between tests

### Test Execution

Run tests automatically through GitHub Actions on each commit. Continuous
integration validates that all tests pass before code merges to main branch.

## Coverage Analysis

### Current Coverage Status

Backend achieves 96.66% function coverage across API routes and database models.
Frontend includes 451 tests that validate component behavior and user
interactions.

Tests use MongoDB Memory Server for database isolation and React Testing Library
for component testing.

### Test Infrastructure Components

Tests include these infrastructure elements:

- MongoDB Memory Server for database testing
- JWT token generation utilities
- Mock API response handlers
- React Testing Library setup
- Database cleanup functions

## Conclusion

Test coverage meets established thresholds across both frontend and backend
systems. The 657 tests validate critical application functionality including
authentication, data management, and user interface behavior.

Coverage metrics indicate that primary application paths include test
validation. Test infrastructure supports continued development through automated
validation and database isolation patterns.
