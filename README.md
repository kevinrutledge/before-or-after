## Overview

### Purpose

Before or After is a casual web-based game designed for anyone with a few spare
moments seeking quick, self-paced entertainment. Each day, players challenge
themselves to guess the release year of various cultural artifacts—albums,
artworks, images, movies, and more—using a simple before-or-after mechanic. This
trivia format keeps the experience fresh and educational, blending addictive
gameplay with knowledge gain.

Review the interactive prototype to understand core game flow and interface
design. The prototype demonstrates landing page functionality, card comparison
mechanics, score tracking displays, leaderboard views, and admin dashboard
layouts. Use the design files that contain detailed mockups and responsive
design patterns.

The prototype guided development of key interface elements. It established
visual hierarchy for game cards, defined navigation patterns that work across
mobile and desktop experiences, and outlined user authentication flows.

## Team

The Merge Masters consists of 5 Cal Poly students. Over the course of about 5
weeks, we worked as a team to deploy this web application.
