## Overview

### Purpose

Before or After is a casual web-based game designed for anyone with a few spare
moments seeking quick, self-paced entertainment. Each day, players challenge
themselves to guess the release year of various cultural artifacts—albums,
artworks, images, movies, and more—using a simple before-or-after mechanic. This
trivia format keeps the experience fresh and educational, blending addictive
gameplay with knowledge gain.

## Team

The Merge Masters consists of 5 Cal Poly students. Over the course of about 5
weeks, we worked as a team to deploy this web application.
