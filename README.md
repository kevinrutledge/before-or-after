## Overview

### Purpose

Lower or Higher is a casual web-based game designed for anyone with a few spare
moments seeking quick, self-paced entertainment. Each day, players challenge
themselves to guess the release year of various cultural artifacts—albums,
artworks, images, movies, and more—using a simple higher-or-lower mechanic. This
trivia format keeps the experience fresh and educational, blending addictive
gameplay with knowledge gain.
